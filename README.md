This is a public demo of HomeOfGiveaways

Welcome to using HomeOfGiveaways! The program shows you the best ongoing giveaways right now. The user interface is in the console and the program gets the giveaway data from an SQLite database. To navigate the menus type the number you want to select and press enter. The giveaways can be ordered by in different ways. To start the program, run MainClass.java.
The demo uses an SQLite database instead of a cloud-based one because of cyber security reasons. Please contact me if you want more information of the full version that uses a cloud database!

Enjoy easily entering giveaways at HomeOfGiveaways!
